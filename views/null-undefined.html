        <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold text-center mb-16">null and undefined in JavaScript</h1>
        <p class="font-medium ">
            In JavaScript, both null and undefined are special values that represent the absence of a meaningful value.
            While they might seem similar, they have distinct use cases:
        </p>

        <div class="mt-6">
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold">null:</h3>
            <ul class="md:ml-9 my-4 list-disc">
                <li class="font-medium mb-4">'null' is a deliberate absence of any value or object. It is often used to
                    indicate that a variable
                    intentionally holds no value or that an object property deliberately doesn't have a value assigned
                    to it.</li>

                <li class="font-medium mb-4">'It is used when you want to explicitly set a variable or property to have
                    no value.</li>

                <li class="font-medium mb-4">For example, if you have a variable that should represent an object but
                    hasn't been initialized yet, you might set it to null to indicate that it's intentionally empty.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="mt-20">
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold">undefined:</h3>
            <ul class="md:ml-9 my-4 list-disc">
                <li class="font-medium mb-4">'undefined typically indicates that a variable has been declared but hasn't
                    been assigned any value, or that an object property hasn't been defined or accessed.</li>

                <li class="font-medium mb-4">It's often used as the default value of uninitialized variables or function
                    parameters that are missing.</li>

                <li class="font-medium mb-4">It can also be the value returned by a function that doesn't explicitly
                    return anything (in which case it's equivalent to returning undefined).
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

    </section>

    <section class="mt-7 p-5">
        <h3 class="font-medium text-3xl">In practice: </h3>

        <ul class="md:ml-9 my-4 list-disc">
            <li class="font-medium mb-4">Use null when you want to explicitly indicate that a variable or object
                property has no value.</li>

            <li class="font-medium mb-4">Use undefined when a variable has been declared but not assigned a value, or
                when you're checking for the absence of a value in an object property or function argument.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="font-bold my-6">It's worth noting that both null and undefined are "falsy" values, meaning they
            evaluate
            to false in a
            boolean context, such as in an if statement. However, they are distinct values with different purposes, so
            it's important to use them appropriately based on their intended meanings in your code.</p>
